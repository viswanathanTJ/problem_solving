1.Given the schema of a Bank Management system, Write a query to display the custid, fname and customer's dob. Display in sorted order of date of birth year and within that sort by firstname.

select custid, fname, dob from customer order by dob asc;


2.Multilevel Inheritance:

Create a class 'Parent'. 'Parent' class should have a method 'add' which prints the addition of 2 integers. Create a class 'Child1' which should be a child class of 'Parent' class. 'Child' class should have a method 'sub' which prints subtraction of 2 integers. Create a class 'Child2' which should be a child class of 'child1' class. 'Child' class should have a method 'mul' which prints multiplication of 2 integers. Create an object for a 'Child' class. Call the 3 methods to add, sub and mul from child class object and display the result.



class Parent:
    def add(a, b):
        return a+b
    pass
class Child1(Parent):
    def sub(a, b):
        return a-b
    pass
class Child2(Child1):
    def mul(a, b):
        return a*b
    pass
if __name__=='__main__':
    a, b = int(input()), int(input())
    c = Child2
    print(c.add(a, b))
    print(c.sub(a, b))
    print(c.mul(a, b))




3.Print the Linked List

In a class, there are N number of students. All the students plan to play a game by creating a circle and pronounce something in numbers which they would like. The main task of the game is to select one student from a given position and pronounce something and then is the turn of next student and so on till one before of the selected student. 

Write a program to print the link list created by you from the given position.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

def insert(head, val):
    new = Node(val)
    if not head: return new
    else:
        cur = head
        while cur.next:
            cur = cur.next
        cur.next = new
    return head

def pprint(k, head, n):
    cur, temp = head, head
    for i in range(k-1):
        cur = cur.next
    while cur:
        print(cur.val, end=' ')
        cur = cur.next
    for i in range(k-1):
        print(temp.val, end=' ')
        temp = temp.next

head = None
n, l, k = int(input()), list(map(int, input().split())), int(input())

for i in l:
    head = insert(head, i)

pprint(k, head, n)
